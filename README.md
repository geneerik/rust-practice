This is a devcontainer setup for vscode to learn rust on the exercism platform; it gives you a ready-to-use envrionment with ide setup and ready to use.  Linting, code helpers, and code styling are all pre-configured.  The `exercism` tool is installed along with bash completion for it.
All you need to do is run `exercism configure --token={TOKEN}`, replacing {TOKEN} with the value from the [https://exercism.io/my/settings] page, then set the project you went, eg.
`exercism download --exercise=hello-world --track=rust`

This is a work in progress, but is functional
